<h1>Hukutaia Explorer App - Guided Trail & Plant Collection</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The Hukutaia Explorer is a mobile app designed and created for the Bay Conservation Alliance. The app has several features showcasing the beautiful region of the Hukutaia Domain in Opotoki, New Zealand. Features include a guided trail walk, with a custom map, pins and images/narratives for specific locations that are triggered by touch or proximity.<br/><br/>
Other features include a functioning plant library with a search bar that displays a collection of plats in the region. When a plant is selected, a detailed page of the plant is shown with a large image, and descriptive text below.<br/><br/> 
There is also link to the website of the Bay Conservation Alliance, and an about us page with more information on the history and culture of the area.
Lastly, there is a log-in feature for the members of the BCA to add plants to the collection. Once logged in, they can access a private upload page where they can fill in a plant form and select a photo from their device to upload.
From here, I check the database monthly and am able to roll out new updates for the application with the new data incorporated.<br/><br/>

This application was designed to fill the knowledge gap between the general public who visit the area, and the rich history, culture and biodiversity of the Hukutaia Domain.
